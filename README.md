Data Summary - The data for this project was collected from Kentucky Department of Education website. Three main data sets were included in the analysis. Teacher Salary included the average certified salary for each of Kentucky's school districts. The Teacher Turnvover Percent was calculated by the dividing the total number of the teachers in that district by the number of teachers who were not employeed. The Working Conditions data set included ratings given by the teachers based on three categores: school leadership, managing student behavior, and school climate.

Project Objective - the objective of this project is to discovery an correlations between several factors and teacher turnover in Kentucky. Kentucky's teachers are leaving the profession in higher numbers than previously seen. I am curious what, if any factors, are most closely related to turnover. The factors I am choosing to compare include: salary and three categories of working conditions: student behavior, school climate, and school leadership. I hope to uncover data that shows any possible correlations.
